# I2C-EEPROM-LCD-LPC2148
This project demonstrates I2C communication using the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller to interface with an external EEPROM. A string is written and read using push buttons, with status displayed on a 16x2 LCD. LEDs indicate write/read operations. Useful for understanding I2C and EEPROM interfacing .
